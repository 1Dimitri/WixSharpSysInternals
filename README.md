# WixSharpSysInternals

This a small project using Oleg Shilo's [Wix#](https://github.com/oleg-shilo/wixsharp) to build a .msi installer for the [Sysinternals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/)
tools.
Tools are downloaded when the .msi is built
The version tag of the package is computed based on the most recent tool found in the archive.
